# GBB
GBB (Gemini Build Builder) is a small tool that helps package code ZIPs generated by Gemini's "Build your ideas with Gemini" feature into a self-contained offline application or web bundle with a single command.

GBB provides broad and stable compatibility for Gemini versions roughly between 2.5 and 3.0, but it is not recommended for packaging apps that require live API calls (extra manual steps required).

## Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm: LTS versions are recommended.

## Usage
- Windows: drag the ZIP onto `gbb.bat`, or run:

```powershell
# Win
gbb path/to/source.zip
```

- Linux / macOS (experimental / not fully stable):

```sh
# Linux/MacOS (not stable)
bash gbb.sh /path/to/source.zip
```

The final product will be saved as platform specific executable, web bundle archive, and portable app.

## Future Plans
1. Collect datasets of code generated by Gemini to improve the tool's compatibility.
2. More features to be determined — contributions and suggestions are welcome.
